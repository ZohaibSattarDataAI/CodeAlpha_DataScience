# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying the species of **Iris flowers** using machine learning techniques. It is a beginner-friendly data science project that demonstrates the full workflow of building a classification model — from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

## 📌 What This Project Does

This notebook performs the following steps:

- **Loads the Iris Dataset**  
  Reads the `.csv` file containing sepal and petal measurements of iris flowers.

- **Explores the Data**  
  Uses visualizations (like `pairplot`) to understand relationships between features.

- **Preprocesses the Dataset**  
  - Drops unnecessary columns (e.g., ID)  
  - Encodes categorical labels into numerical form

- **Splits Data into Train and Test Sets**  
  Uses 60% of the data for training and 40% for testing.

- **Trains a Machine Learning Model**  
  Applies Random Forest Classifier to classify the flower species.

- **Evaluates the Model**  
  Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

- **Visualizes Results**  
  Plots a confusion matrix heatmap to better understand prediction performance.

- **Predicts New Samples**  
  Takes new flower measurements and predicts the species.

## 🧠 ML Techniques Used

- Supervised Learning  
- Classification (**Random Forest**)  
- Label Encoding  
- Train/Test Split
