#🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning
<br>
This project focuses on classifying the species of Iris flowers using machine learning techniques. It is a beginner-friendly data science project that demonstrates the full workflow of building a classification model — from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.
<br>
🚀 What This Project Does
This notebook performs the following steps:
<br>
Loads the Iris Dataset
<br>
Reads the .csv file containing sepal and petal measurements of iris flowers.
<br>
Explores the Data
<br>
Uses visualizations (like pairplot) to understand relationships between features.
<br>
Preprocesses the Dataset
<br>
Drops unnecessary columns (e.g., ID)
<br>
Encodes categorical labels into numerical form
<br>
Splits Data into Train and Test Sets
<br>
60% data for training and 40% for testing
<br>
Trains a Machine Learning Model
<br>
Applies Random Forest Classifier to classify the species.
<br>
Evaluates the Model
<br>
Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
<br>
Visualizes Results
<br>
Plots a confusion matrix heatmap for better understanding of predictions.
<br>
Predicts New Samples
<br>
Takes new flower measurements and predicts the species.
<br>
