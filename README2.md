# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning | DataScience3
This project, titled DataScience3, focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars using machine learning algorithms. It's an ideal project for beginners in data science who want to learn regression modeling and end-to-end ML workflows — from data preprocessing to final predictions and performance evaluation.

## 📌 What This Project Does
This notebook includes the following major steps:

• Loads and Displays the Dataset
Reads a .csv file containing features like Car_Name, Year, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Transmission, and more.

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizes data distributions and correlations

Uses scatter plots, histograms, and pairplots to uncover relationships

• Data Preprocessing
Handles missing values

Converts categorical features using LabelEncoder

Feature engineering: derives car age from the Year column

• Train/Test Split
Splits the dataset (80% training, 20% testing)

• Model Training
Trains a Random Forest Regressor model using selected features

• Model Evaluation
Evaluates the trained model using regression metrics:
R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

• Prediction & Interpretation
Predicts the selling price of a new car given user-defined input

Visual comparison of Actual vs Predicted values

## 📁 Dataset Used
• File: car data.csv
🔸 Features:
Car_Name

Year

Present_Price

Kms_Driven

Fuel_Type

Transmission

Selling_type

Owner

## 🎯 Target:
Selling_Price

## 🧠 ML Techniques Used
Supervised Learning

Regression Modeling using Random Forest Regressor

Label Encoding for Categorical Variables

Train/Test Split

Model Evaluation using standard regression metrics

## 📊 Output Example
Model R² Score on Test Set: ~88–95%

## Prediction Example:
For input [69, 2017, 12.50, 9000, 1, 0, 1, 0], the model accurately predicts the selling price.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
Hands-on experience with the complete machine learning pipeline

Practical use of Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib

Application of encoding, feature selection, model training, and performance visualization

Clear understanding of how regression can be used in real-world problems
